# hourglass

Watchface for Watchy (SQFMI)

no wifi, no bluetooth but long battery life

there is a time adjustment routine in Uhr.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 500 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

left hourglass - hours

right hourglass - minutes

by pressing the right upper button you can switch between the two watchfaces
